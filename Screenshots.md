libvt100 comes with a small executable to read a file with VT100/ANSI commands and then renders them onto a virtual screen and saved that file to a PNG file.

You can have some fun by downloading files from http://sixteencolors.net/ and rendering them using libvt100. This also serves as a measuring stick to see how close to "correct" ANSI handling we are.
