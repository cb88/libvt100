# Introduction #

Because the ANSI and VT100 "standards" have evolved over time and with many different vendors in the mix there is no definite "specification" but these links describes some of the commands available:

[VT100 commands](http://www.braun-home.net/michael/info/misc/VT100_commands.htm)

[ANSI Escape Sequences from a place called ASCII Table](http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php)

Guessing **what** the command _actually_ does is up to us :)
